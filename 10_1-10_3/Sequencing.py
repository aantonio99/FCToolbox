@summary: Sequencing is an open-source python and arcPy code.
          This script has been developed to ensure a good orientation and and to sequence the network from 
          upstream to downstream. The code start from the outlet and go upstream. The first stream is attributed
          with an "Order_ID" of 1. Next up stream with an "Order_ID" of 2 and so on. For each stream, the
          orientation is checked and eventually corrected. Computation time of this module directly depends on
          the drainage density.
